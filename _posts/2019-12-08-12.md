Folks, sorry for the delay on the release of this episode.  We're getting into the holiday season here in the United States, and we've had to do some traveling.

This episode caps off at November 20th.  Episode 13th will be recorded soon, and will fill in the gaps (slightly extended as well), so stay tuned!
