## Projects of the Week

Every episode we promote (at least) one "project of the week".
These are open-source .NET-related projects that we find interesting and deserving of attention, accolades, and contribution.
This page is a list of all the projects we've highlighted so far (partly for your benefit, partly for us to keep track so we don't mention a project over again!)
